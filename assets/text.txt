Hello.
I am a Web Developer. 
I've worked as a sales manager in the past, and now I pursue my dream of becoming a professional programmer.

My Skills

Development & Communication
I started learning to code in the middleschool, and the teacher always encouraged us to work in groups, thus I have a lot of experience in project communication.

Rubick's Cube
I love solving a Rubick's Cube to achieve higher speeds and let my brain rest from work and problem solving
